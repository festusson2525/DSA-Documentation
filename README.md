# DSA-Documentation
This is where I started my Portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with Incubator Hub. 

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building

## Project Topic: E commerce Sale Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data receievd, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best perfomance from our data.

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used here is Data sale.csv and this is an open source data that can freely be downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel (for Data Cleaning) [Download here](https://microsoft.com/)
- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)
- Power BI (For creating a report)
- Ms Power Point(For making Presentation)

### Data cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which products are top sellers
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic line of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis

``` SQL
SELECT A,B,C
WHERE A > 15
```
